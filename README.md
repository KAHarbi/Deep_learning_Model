# Deep_learning_Model

## Problem statement
In this project, we will use data from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fmena14/crowd-counting/code). When we faced crowd gathering problems, we must perfectly manage them, and through the application of deep learning in this field, we will take real-time pictures of the places capable of unorganized gathering and monitor them, 
and through the application of deep learning, the model will give an alert when a limit is reached To manage crowds and give crowd alerts, so they will 
be organized using our model.

<br/>

## Prediction
we create a model for counting people in the Crowd.

## Data Description 
Several data have been collected, including the Holy Mosque of Mecca and some areas of the Riyadh season, 
like winter wonderland, Assalam park. The model has been applied to it.
